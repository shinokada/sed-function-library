    <h1>50 <code>sed</code> Command Examples</h1>
    <p>From <a href="https://linuxhint.com/50_sed_command_examples">50 sed command examples</a></p>
    <p><code>sed</code> is a useful text processing feature of GNU/Linux. The full form of <code>sed</code> is Stream
      Editor. Many types of simple and complicated text processing tasks can be done very easily by using
      <code>sed</code> command. Any particular string in a text or a file can be searched, replaced and deleted by using
      regular expression with <code>sed</code> command. But this commands performs all types of modification temporarily
      and the original file content is not changed by default. The user can store the modified content into another file
      if needs. The basic uses of <code>sed</code> command are explained in this tutorial by using 50 unique
      examples.Before starting this tutorial you must check the installed version of <code>sed</code> in your operating
      system by running the following command. The tutorial is designed based on GNU sed. So this version of
      <code>sed</code> will be required to practice the examples shown in this tutorial.</p>
    <pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">$ sed --version</code></pre>
    <p>The following output shows that GNU Sed of version 4.4 is installed in the system.</p>

      <pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">sed [options]…  [script] [file]</code></pre>
      <p>If no filename is provided with <code>sed</code> command, then the script will work on standard input data. The
        <code>sed</code> script can be executed without any option.</p>

      <h2>Basic text substitution using ‘sed’</h2>
      <p>Any particular part of a text can be searched and replaced by using searching and replacing pattern by using
        <code>sed</code> command. In the following example, ‘s’ indicates the search and replace task. The word ‘Bash’
        will be searched in the text, “Bash Scripting Language” and if the word exists in the text then it will be
        replaced by the word ‘Perl’.</p>
      <pre
        class="language-text"><code class="language-text">$ echo "Bash Scripting Language" | sed 's/Bash/Perl/'</code></pre>
      <section id="output" class="level3">
        <h3>Output:</h3>
        <p>The word, ‘Bash’ exists in the text. So the output is ‘Perl Scripting Language’.</p>
        <pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">Perl Scripting Language</code></pre>
        <p><code>sed</code> command can be used to substitution any part of a file content also. Create a text file
          named weekday.txt with the following content.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="weekdaytxt" class="level3">
        <h3>weekday.txt</h3>
        <pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
Saturday
Sunday</code></pre>
        <p>The following command will search and replace the text ‘Sunday ‘, by the text ‘Sunday is holiday’.</p>
        <pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">$ cat weekday.txt
$ sed 's/Sunday/Sunday is holiday/' weekday.txt</code></pre>
      </section>
      <section id="output-1" class="level3">
        <h3>Output:</h3>
        <p>‘Sunday’ exists in weekday.txt file and this word is replaced by the text, ‘Sunday is holiday’ after
          executing the above <code>sed</code> command.</p>

      <h2>Replace all instances of a text in a particular line of a file using ‘g’ option</h2>
      <p>‘g’ option is used in <code>sed</code> command to replace all occurrences of matching pattern. Create a text
        file named python.txt with the following content to know the use of ‘g’ option. This file contains the word.
        ‘Python’ multiple times.</p>
      <p>python.txt</p>

      <p>The following command will replace all occurrences of ‘Python’ in the second line of the file, python.txt.
        Here, ‘Python’ occurs two times in the second line.</p>
      <pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">$ cat python.txt

      <p>If any word appears multiple times in a file then the particular occurrence of the word in each line can be
        replaced by using <code>sed</code> command with the occurrence number. The following <code>sed</code> command
        will replace the second occurrence of the searching pattern in each line of the file, python.txt.</p>
