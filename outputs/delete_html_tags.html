    50 sed Command Examples
    From 50 sed command examples
    sed is a useful text processing feature of GNU/Linux. The full form of sed is Stream
      Editor. Many types of simple and complicated text processing tasks can be done very easily by using
      sed command. Any particular string in a text or a file can be searched, replaced and deleted by using
      regular expression with sed command. But this commands performs all types of modification temporarily
      and the original file content is not changed by default. The user can store the modified content into another file
      if needs. The basic uses of sed command are explained in this tutorial by using 50 unique
      examples.Before starting this tutorial you must check the installed version of sed in your operating
      system by running the following command. The tutorial is designed based on GNU sed. So this version of
      sed will be required to practice the examples shown in this tutorial.
    $ sed --version
    The following output shows that GNU Sed of version 4.4 is installed in the system.
    
      Syntax:
      sed [options]…  [script] [file]

        sed script can be executed without any option.

        Basic text substitution using ‘sed’
        Replace all instances of a text in a particular line of a file by using ‘g’ option
        Replace the second occurrence only of a match on each line
        Replace the last occurrence only of a match on each line
        Replace the first match in a file with new text
      
    
    
      Basic text substitution using ‘sed’
      Any particular part of a text can be searched and replaced by using searching and replacing pattern by using
        sed command. In the following example, ‘s’ indicates the search and replace task. The word ‘Bash’
        will be searched in the text, “Bash Scripting Language” and if the word exists in the text then it will be
        replaced by the word ‘Perl’.
      $ echo "Bash Scripting Language" | sed 's/Bash/Perl/'
      
        Output:
        The word, ‘Bash’ exists in the text. So the output is ‘Perl Scripting Language’.
        Perl Scripting Language
        sed command can be used to substitution any part of a file content also. Create a text file
          named weekday.txt with the following content.
      
      
        weekday.txt
        Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
Saturday
Sunday
        The following command will search and replace the text ‘Sunday ‘, by the text ‘Sunday is holiday’.
        $ cat weekday.txt
$ sed 's/Sunday/Sunday is holiday/' weekday.txt
      
      
        Output:
        ‘Sunday’ exists in weekday.txt file and this word is replaced by the text, ‘Sunday is holiday’ after
          executing the above sed command.
        Monday 
Tuesday 
Wednesday 
Thursday 
Friday 
Saturday 
Sunday is holiday
      
    
    
      Replace all instances of a text in a particular line of a file using ‘g’ option
      ‘g’ option is used in sed command to replace all occurrences of matching pattern. Create a text
        file named python.txt with the following content to know the use of ‘g’ option. This file contains the word.
        ‘Python’ multiple times.
      python.txt
      Python is a very popular language.
Python is easy to use. Python is easy to learn.
Python is a cross-platform language
      The following command will replace all occurrences of ‘Python’ in the second line of the file, python.txt.
        Here, ‘Python’ occurs two times in the second line.
      $ cat python.txt
$ sed '2 s/Python/perl/g' python.txt
      
        Output:
        The following output will appear after running the script. Here, All occurrence of ‘Python’ in the second
          line is replaced by ‘Perl’.
        Python is a very popular language.
perl is easy to use. perl is easy to learn.
Python is a cross-platform language%  
      
    
    
      Replace the second occurrence only of a match on each line
      If any word appears multiple times in a file then the particular occurrence of the word in each line can be
        replaced by using sed command with the occurrence number. The following sed command
        will replace the second occurrence of the searching pattern in each line of the file, python.txt.
      $ sed 's/Python/perl/g2' python.txt
      
        Output:
        The following output will appear after running the above command. Here, the searching text, ‘Python’ appears
          two times in the second line only and it is replaced by the text, ‘perl‘.
        Python is a very popular language.
Python is easy to use. perl is easy to learn.
Python is a cross-platform language%  
      
    
    
      Replace the last occurrence only of a match on each line
      Create a text file named lang.txt with the following content.
      lang.txt
      Bash Programming Language.  Python Programming Language. Perl Programming Language.
Hypertext Markup Language.
Extensible Markup Language.
      $ sed 's/\(.*\)Programming/\1Scripting/' lang.txt
      The \1 refers to the characters captured by the escaped parentheses.
      Read
      
        Output:
        Bash Programming Language. Python Programming Language. Perl Scripting Language.
